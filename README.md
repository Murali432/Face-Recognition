Developed a real-time face detection and recognition system using OpenCV in Python,integrated within PyCharm IDE. 
The project utilized Haar cascades for facial feature detection and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) for accurate face recognition. 
Implemented the system to efficiently identify and verify individuals in live video streams.
